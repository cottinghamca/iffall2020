        <h3>[Intro]</h3>
        <p>Is that where we're at?</p>
        <br>

        <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
        <p>If we reach up as the waters climb in us</p>
        <p>The hardest parts</p>
        <p>Blind to reason, lose the sight of what's to come</p>
        <p>Below or what's above</p>
        <p>Fall in the rain, keeping the sun below us</p>
        <p>Set away your hate</p>
        <br>

        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>And oh</p>
        <p>Why'd you spend your time leading the chorus</p>
        <p>When the war was just waiting before us?</p>
        <p>As if you didn't know</p>
        <p>You ignored all the darkest of warnings</p>
        <p>Found our end in the silence of morning</p>
        <p>It fell beneath the cold</p>
        <br>

        <h3>[Post-Chorus]</h3>
        <p>I'll take the desert, you take the coast</p>
        <p>But to each his own</p>
        <p>I'll take the desert</p>
        <br>

        <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
        <p>If we reach up as the waters climb in us</p>
        <p>The hardest parts of the silence</p>
        <p>Tried to mark the fallen snow</p>
        <p>We'll leave you here, you know</p>
        <br>

        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>Why'd you spend your time leading the chorus</p>
        <p>When the war was just waiting before us</p>
        <p>As if you didn't know</p>
        <p>You ignored all the darkest of warnings</p>
        <p>Found our end in the silence of morning</p>
        <p>It fell beneath the cold</p>
        <br>

        <h3>[Post-Chorus]</h3>
        <p>I'll take the desert, you take the coast</p>
        <p>But to each his own</p>
        <p>I'll take the desert, you take the coast</p>
        <p>But to each his own</p>
        <br>

        <h3>[Instrumental Outro]</h3>
